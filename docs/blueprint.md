# Personal Data Manager App Blueprint

## Overview:

- The Personal Data Manager app is designed to securely store and manage personal information, providing users with an intuitive interface for easy data entry and retrieval.

I Also tried for integrating Artificial intelligence for this project but it asking api keys i brought from gemini apimodel: googleai/gemini-2.0-flash but more issue in type script i am still learning , so my making 4 th sem mini project so i think this colud be better , if I take risk more i could be more diffult to handle all the codes . Thank you . 

## Objectives:
- To develop a Personal Data Manager that securely organizes and manages user information.
- To provide an intuitive user interface for seamless data entry and retrieval.
- To implement data encryption for enhanced security and privacy.
- To allow multi-device synchronization for easy access across platforms.
- To integrate reminder and notification features for important dates and tasks.
- To ensure data backup and recovery to prevent information loss.

## Design Considerations:
### Dark Mode:
- Ensure all UI elements are adaptable to dark mode, maintaining readability and accessibility.xx
- Primary color: Dark blue for a professional and secure feel. In dark mode, use a lighter shade of blue.
- Secondary color: Light gray for backgrounds and subtle accents. In dark mode, use a darker shade of gray.
- Accent: Teal for interactive elements and highlights. Ensure the teal is still visible and accessible in dark mode.
- Clean and minimalist layout with clear sections for data entry, display, and settings.
- Use a consistent set of icons for categories and actions, ensuring clarity and ease of use. Adapt icon colors for dark mode to maintain visibility.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions. Ensure animations are still visible and appropriate in dark mode.
